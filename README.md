Various Utilities I have written to make my life easier.

* interactive_rename.sh  - CLI interactive rename utility
* README.md              - this file
* tell_time.sh           - Script to tell you the time via audio
* move_good.sh           - Script to only move files that the fil command says are 
 mp3 music file
 mp4 music files
 movie files
 gif files
 jpeg files
  Used to retive good files from a drive that was crypt attacked.
* find_copies.sh         - Script to find other copies of files
    This script has a search path hard coded in it... will someday fix that...

* addate2name.sh         - add the date on the file to the name of the file 
     Had a webcam that auto generated the file name with the date... well the camera wasn't real good at keeping the date.  So wrote this script to added the date on the file to the start of the filename.
