# Utilities

Various Utilities I have written to make my life easier.

* interactive_rename.sh  - CLI interactive rename utility
* README.md              - this file
* tell_time.sh           - Script to tell you the time via audio
* move_good.sh		 - Script to only move files that the fil command says are 
 mp3 music file
 mp4 music files
 movie files
 gif files
 jpeg files
  Used to retive good files from a drive that was crypt attacked.
* find_copies.sh         - Script to find other copies of files
    This script has a search path hard coded in it... will someday fix that...
